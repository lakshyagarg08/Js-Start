const name = "lakshya"
const repoCount =  50

// console.log(name +  repoCount + " tell");  Outdated sytax

console.log( `Hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}`);
//  Better way to write code
// This is called string Interpolation

const gameName = new String("Lakshyaa")
console.log(gameName[0])
